Well then boy have I got the dog for you! Apolo, although he was a bit shy when he first arrived at the Brooklyn ACC, is learning to trust (and adore!) his people, and he is an absolute sweetheart once you're in the \"inner circle.\" Apolo seems to be house trained, only pulls a teeny bit on the leash, and absolutely loves to give kisses. Today we spent some time hanging out in the outdoor play area, and the second he was off the leash, Apolo was up on the bench next to me trying to lick my entire face. Come and meet this sweet boy at the Brooklyn ACC today!",

Theo has not spent time in the home around other animals or children, so it is unknown how he will react to them. He also stated that Theo will struggle to get away when being held, but he likes to be petted. Theo likes to rearrange his enclosure, and will chew on cords. He enjoys being brushed and he isn't bothered if he is put in a carrier. A volunteer writes: Theo is a spunky, fun-loving bun who loves to run around, binky in the air and zestily enjoy a good rabbit chew toy. Of course, Theo is also down to relax and enjoy some human affection, after he's had a nice run-around.",

But you don't have to wait for happy hour to turn that frown upside down. 5 year-old Miller will have you feeling giddy, light-headed, and tipsy with joy, and that's just at the sight of his face. Our little raisinette is utterly irresistible with one smoosh-able gorilla nose, two velvet ears just made for rubbing, and an infinite amount of forehead wrinkles designed to make everyone \"ooh\" and \"ahh.\" But the very best part of sweet, petite Miller would have to be, without question, his eyes. Brimming with soul - chock full of life's little nothings, wonderful somethings, and loves that have come and gone - Miller's eyes seem almost too big for his body, so much world on such a small frame. But no matter Miller's past he is all about the present. He is a lover of walks, of snacks, and of talks (well more of a listener, really), and to spend an afternoon with this chocolate firefly is to watch the time fly by. Miller is said previously to have lived with children ages 5 months to 14 years, and is described as playful, tolerant, and gentle when with them. Miller walks nicely on leash, takes his treats gently, and was exceptionally tolerant of being tethered for photos and wearing his warm, winter coat. Miller appears to be housebroken and has been social and tolerant of other dogs while at the shelter. It's 5 o'clock somewhere, but there's one time of day guaranteed to leave your head feeling tipsy, your heart feeling full, and your home just bursting with love. That's Miller time. Miller is waiting in adoptions at Manhattan ACC.",

If her stunning smile doesn't win you over on the spot she's got lots of snuggles to offer too and enough energy to power the city for days so you'll never want for a playful sidekick. Fresh out of an adoring foster home, we're told Medusa was friendly to everyone she met, loved to cuddle on the couch and slept on her own bed every night. She would lay on her back on the floor and wiggle for 15 minutes at a time and to quote her foster Mom, if you're not giving her belly rubs by this point, you might want to check if you have a pulse at all! Medusa's a petite gal but very strong so a harness leash helps with walks and while she can't wait to engage with other pups, her enthusiastic manners can be a bit overwhelming for some dogs so a home with only very tolerant and playful siblings is a must. Medusa herself is extremely tolerant of others and when playing with a puppy she wasn't even bothered by his mouthing her ears and legs, all she wanted was to have fun! She loves toys and treats and already knows how to sit and wait for them too, not to mention posing like a pro for photos and everyone lucky enough to meet her leaves with a smile on their face almost as big as her own. Medusa's an all around great dog and with a little bit of basic training, she's going to be a beautiful pet who'll fill her new family's life with years of joyful, loyal companionship. Ask to meet her today!",

He's more into smelling the grass (and maybe taking a nibble), trying to hop into random cars, or checking in with his neighbor-dogs. Mista likes to go his own way, loves to explore, and would do great with an adventurous adopter who can take him out to explore the world. Could that be you? Come and meet Mista and find out!",

    "description": "A Foster Writes:\n\nJohnny is one of the sweetest dogs we've ever met! He's really loyal, but also kind to strangers and always happy to meet new people. We found that he loves following us around the house, and always wants to be with you, but given a good chew toy or bone he can occupy himself for hours. He doesn't seem to mind being home alone for longer periods, and he always greets us when we come home with excitement and affection. Though he never barked when we were with him (even on walks outside) or when he's with other people, we found that in the first couple of days before he was acclimated he barked during the day, or occasionally howled when he thought nobody was coming back. After the first week my neighbors informed me that he had stopped making noise throughout the day and was being a good boy!\n\nJohnny knows 'stay', 'no', and in the small time that we fostered him he even learned how to 'sit'; he seems to be a really intelligent boy! He's really calm and well behaved in public, and would even sit down inside coffee shops when we were at the counter ordering. He had only one pee and one poo accident in the apt in the first handful of days, but we think that was due to the anxiety of a new place and moving environments. We would give him food in the morning, but he seemed to self-regulate his eating so that he would only eat when he knew he could go to the bathroom soon after. Often times we'd come home at the end of the day and he hadn't eaten much of his food, but then would immediately eat all of it and want to go for a walk. \n\nHe loves physical play, and often times we'd tackle and roll around on the floor with him, but he never became mean or aggressive, and certainly never hurt us in any way. He's a very curious boy, and is distracted, almost hypnotized, when on the street for a walk. He does love a good run around the park, and can seemingly run forever. He loves smelling almost everything outside which, although is very cute, we found we needed to watch closely. On a couple occasions he found something on the street and snatched it up in his mouth, but we quickly became comfortable and trusting enough with Johnny that we would open his mouth and he would let us take it out with our fingers.\n\nJohnny is pretty much the perfect dog in every way. At least twice every walk a stranger would comment on how beautiful he is (he's really a knockout), and he definitely doesn't mind the attention. He's a lovely energy to have in the home, and we don't doubt that he will make someone the happiest parent one day.",

I think we can all agree that there's one four-legged campaign to really get behind. Marla's main focus points? Well first she wants to bring back perfect puppy manners. Of course ALL our pups have wonderful manners. But given Marla's significant experience with picture-perfect \"sits,\" elegant treat-takings, and debutante walks, she's the ideal candidate to lead every pup in America in the world! To the garden of effortless etiquette. What's Marla against? Well for one - lack of snacks. Studies have shown (disclaimer: Marla conducted the studies) that most pups don't receive anywhere NEAR enough snacks! One, two, three bones a day? With Marla as Pup President every pup will receive EXACTLY the number of snacks that Marla herself finds suitable. And that number is known as \"infinite.\" Currently Marla is running unopposed but if she were to face an opponent? Well really that would never work. Because on top of perfect manners and a passion for snacks, Marla also has a passion for other pups (her current job title is \"Resident Playgroup Star.\"). So more than likely they'd run together. What else should you know about Marla? Let's see. Well she's tough on toys (squeaky ones especially), soft on hugs (long ones preferably), and committed to making every morning a drool-worthy morning for all of her constituents! So come meet Marla today and then cast your vote! Marla for President! (Of your heart that is.) Marla is campaigning in adoptions at Manhattan ACC.",

A platinum-coated cutie with a heart of pure gold, he's the most gentle and gentlemanly dog I've ever met. Life hasn't been all that kind to him--his coat is patchy, he needs feeding up, and his nails are long--but Gonzo himself is kindness personified, so easy to handle and eager to please, so snuggly and soft, so charming in every possible way. He comes, sits and even hugs on command, takes treats and toys gently, walks nicely on leash, seems house trained and gets along famously with dogs of both sexes. It sounds like he was bonded closely to his sister Camilla (already adopted) as he was 'always by her side' and we're told they even shared the same crate when bedding down for the night. How adorable is that? With Gonzo, what you see is exactly what you get: a sweet, smushy teddy bear of a dog who'd make the most wonderful addition to any family.

With beautifully refined, hound-like features, the softest, most adorably floppy ears, and a pair of amber eyes that seem to have the world behind them, 2 year-old Wicker easily carries that crown. But while his name might suggest one chilly Chicago winter, Wicker is as warm and easy as an armchair on the porch, perched in the summer sun. This cinnamon-coated cutie is quick to join me on a walk and right away I'm impressed with his manners. At approximately 60 pounds, with a healthy build and long, lanky legs, Wicker could easily be one to pull you away on leash, but instead strolls easily ahead of my stride. Once at the park Wicker does grow a bit anxious. Those eyes with the world behind them seem to scan every face that passes us by, searching for one he knows. And when I briefly tether him and leave his side to quickly snap a few photos, Wicker cries softly to himself and then in my direction, the sound caught up on the wind in the very small space between us. Wicker comes to us as an owner surrender having lived with his prior family for one year. He is said to be friendly with other dogs large and small, and also to enjoy the company of children even sometimes laying himself \"down next to them.\" Despite Wicker's young age there's a calm and maturity about him, and again, those eyes, as if he's lived twice as many lives. And when we wrap up our time together, stroll back quietly and quickly, back through his kennel door, he holds my gaze a little longer than necessary before quietly settling back onto his bed. Handsome Wicker would do best with a family with an average amount of dog experience. One who will give him plenty of snacks and love, and never keep more than a small space between their hearts. Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the luckiest of them all? That would be the one who goes on to share their life with Wicker. And lives happily ever after. Wicker is waiting in adoptions at Manhattan ACC.",

I realized Zelda was the right name for this intriguing, sometimes a-little-crazy-seeming, enigmatic but fascinating feline.\n\nA petite cat with long, slender legs, Zelda appears almost kitten-like, and her often playful behavior (she really enjoys batting around toys, including a small pumpkin which has turned up mysteriously in different places all over the apartment) reinforces the idea that she's just a baby. I was surprised over the months when she didn't get bigger, as I'd assumed she was still growing.\n\nThis Zelda knows how to have fun, but you wouldn't want to throw her a surprise party. She is cautious and apprehensive around people, not quite sure if she can trust you. But that makes her shows of affection and expressions of comfort that much more meaningful; I love that when I call her at night, she comes running in and jumps on the bed, with an adorable chirp/meow. Since even now, after months together, she still tends to be skittish around me, I don't take for granted when she cuddles up on or near me, and delight when I see her happily kneading away. She really enjoys being pet under the chin/on the cheek--you'll hear her appreciative purr--but she needs the petting to be her idea. Best to show her your hand and let her come to head-butt it, or wait for her to give another signal that she's ready to be pet.\n\nZelda would do best with someone who is fluent in Cat, able to give her space when she needs it and not rush any interactions. She'd also thrive in a home with another cat. While she likely won't come out to entertain your human friends, she LOVES other cats.\n\nEven when she first arrived and was confined to a crate so her leg could heal, she was flirting with my two cats, rubbing the crate bars whenever they came near. When, during an out-of-crate adventure she hid under the bed for a half hour, I was able to get her out not with food or treats but with a very patient tabby by the side of the bed, whom she just couldn't resist.\n\nA few other things to know about Zelda:\n-she is a cat burglar. More than once, she's moved my earrings or necklaces around, and I've learned not to leave any jewelry out on the dresser for her to scamper away with.\n-she may like to snuggle up in a carrier, but she does not like being put into one\n-she's pretty great :-)",

He sits beautifully, stays, shakes hands with both paws, takes treats so gently from my fingers and comes when called. As we entered the yard, Sage immediately spotted a tennis ball, seized it and started to play, on his own , then brought it at my feet.  Let's start... Let's play.... Let's have fun... Beside the fact that he slipped quite often on the turf, Sage was a good runner, catcher and excellent at head shots. He always brought back the ball to me  to continue the game, waiting patiently for me to throw but ready to bounce, all eyes on the ball... I like when a dog has good control of his/her impulses. Someone must have taught Sage and even taken good care of him...He is quite a handsome dog and although I know he is a boroughbred , I would love  to know his ancestry. Sage  is at the Manhattan Care Center, a  good, social  and playful dog looking for a new loving owner or family...

He is obviously well trained, so calm and tranquil in his kennel, and he offers his paw for a shake on command. He doesn't bark or jump up or bounce around, he's happy to play with his toys until someone is ready to play with him (don't expect him to give up his toy unless he knows you're going to throw it).  He seemed to know how taken I was with him, because he sat patiently, looking at me with soft eyes, as if to say, \"I'm ready when you are, but take your time, I can wait, you're the boss and I'm here for you.\"  He's very solid and symmetrical; he looks like an American Bulldog who could put on a few pounds.  He seemed to do well in a playgroup with both male and female dogs. He exudes confidence and I can imagine how proud someone will be marching around with him.  I imagine his name as \"Chief\" or \"the Colonel,\" and everyone who passes by calls out \"Hey Chief,\" or \"it's the Colonel.\"  Somebody better come get him ASAP, so he can start his new life, and I can get back to mine.",

Leashed easily, Ace was pretty good during our stroll around the block, not forgetting to do his business.  He did not really pay attention to birds or other pooches. He is such a cutie, an \"overgrown little dog\" at 37 pounds, so well cared for and beautifully groomed. Free to roam in the yard, Ace was a first timid with me. We spent a good hour together, and Ace went from running away from me and not accepting treats to sitting next to me for caresses and playing happily and energetically with a toy. I was quite happy with the transformation. He was a totally different little dog, probably just the real Ace, coming to life an out of his shy shell. Ace is looking for an active owner who likes to run and play, but also an experienced human who will not only channel his energy but also make him more relaxed around new people  or new circumstances. Our Ace could be your King of Hearts if you offer him your love and the warmth of your home.",

She is a simple dog who likes to eat, play and sleep.\n\nShe is not in a hurry to go out in the morning which is convenient to getting up and having coffee before taking her out for her first walk.  That could be anywhere between 8 and 10 am.  After a walk around the reservoir she has breakfast and takes a nap or has a game of tug of war or fetch before a nap.  She prefers to sleep next to me on the couch but will go over to \"her chair\" or her bed when asked a few times.  I like to tuck her in with one of her many soft blankets.  \n\nWhen she first arrived she barked quite a bit at the slightest noise outside our door on the first floor but that has decreased by about 80%.  She is a big mush especially if she thinks you have a treat.  \n\nShe goes out at least 3 times a day 5 or 6 hrs apart but can go out more.  She does not like to go out in the rain and wants to get home when she is done.  Then she is ready for \"get the toy\" and will play tug of war.  We also play \"get the ball\" and have been working on \"drop it\"  which happens quite well especially if you have treats.\n\nShe gets her paws wiped after each walk and have been practicing \"give me your paw\".  This is getting better, front paws more so than the back.  She is not a fan of getting her back paws wiped but tolerates and never growls.  \n\nSometimes she will roll over on her back for belly rubs and has the softest chest, like some ultra luxurious suede.\n\nPenny was getting a can of food in the morning and a can in the evening but she always seems to be looking for more. Recently she has been getting and additional half can after her last walk.  She does not get any table food.  \n\nIf she needs to go out she gets up and starts sniffing the floor, this is something i have just recently noticed.  Depending on our schedule she will go out at 8am, 2pm and 8pm but this is pretty flexible with another walk sometimes in between.\n\nI think Penny is a perfect dog except when she sees comes unexpectedly upon another dog, as she will pull and lunge towards them.  It is only when we are unprepared that it is an issue.  When we see them coming we prepare and get out of the way\n\nPenny will not relieve herself right outside no matter how badly she has to go.   She will only go on dirt or leaves.",

For there's a puffy white cloud with a laffy-taffy tongue just waiting to make your acquaintance. Now, one might accuse 1 year-old Beauty's name of stating the obvious. With an ivory, velveteen coat, smiling, light emerald eyes, and two sweet face freckles added just for good measure, one would be hard-pressed to find a better incarnation of springtime, or a more lovely face on which to gaze. But I think Beauty might have been named instead for all that lies within her. Who, by the way, I'm fairly convinced is a person. \"Join me for a walk, Beauty?\" And she cocks her head to one side and squints one emerald eye clearly saying, \"Yes, of course, silly lady, let's go!\" \"Isn't it beautiful out today, Beauty?\" To which she purses her perfect jowls, gives the matter considerable thought, before breaking out into smiles, \"Why yes, yes it is!\" \"Shake that bootie, Beauty!\" I laughingly sing as she prances along ahead of me. Which prompts what can only be described as a clear and obvious eye roll, our snowball un-amused at my humor. Beauty comes to us as an owner surrender, having previously lived with children ages 6, 8, and 10. She is said to be playful and exuberant with them, and also to enjoy the company of dogs big and small, while kitties (the hissing kind) reportedly scare her. During our time together Beauty pulls considerably on leash until she finds a nice bench perfect for wasting away the day, and then contentedly flops on her belly. \"What a perfect way to spend an afternoon,\" I whisper to Beauty. \"Can you think of anything better?\" And behind those light emerald, very-possibly-human eyes, I see Beauty think of one thing. The thing I, too, hope she finds soon. Beauty is waiting in adoptions at Manhattan ACC.",

He's a stunning dog in a soft coat, a little stump of a tail that's always wagging, and a face that lights up when people are near.   He may be housebroken as going potty was a priority as soon as we were out the door, and when business is done, rolling in for cuddles is his next priority.    Browdy loves attention, comes when called for more cuddles, and although his tail is so short it's hard to see, it never stops wagging.   He's the sweetest dog who has some physical issues (bad back legs), but that doesn't stop him from going for slow short walks, navigating stairs up and down, and stepping in and out of his kennel.   Cuddly, soft, sweet, gentle, I loved spending time with him, and I know the person or family that adopts this sweet boy will enjoy spoiling him.   He's such a sweetheart, making the best out of his current  situation.  Let's make it the best it can be so that Browdy can retire with all the comforts of home.   Ask to meet him today.",

She would do best with someone who runs, bikes, and/or has plenty of time for long walks, games of fetch, and tug-of-war.

Mochi is all brown except for a vestigial little Dutch triangle on her nose and a cute white \"mitten\" on her left front foot. Another volunteer writes:  Is this not the cutest bun-bun alive?!  She has a tiny white button nose surrounded by a circle of black that fades into a silvery brown-colored coat.  She was at the front of her kennel with that button-nose pressed through the bars.  I opened the door, of course, and she stretched full out for a leisurely petting session.  Something I've never seen before in a rabbit -- when I pet and scritched her between the hocks, she lifted her back legs up in a yoga pose, just the way dogs and cats do to let you know you've hit the sweet spot.  Since bunnies (like horses) have eyes on the sides of their faces, rather than a forward-facing straight gaze, it's sometimes hard to gauge what their thinking.  Mochi, though, is one of the most expressive bun-pups I've ever met. Prepare to be charmed.",

Despite such a big life change (he was with his family since he was a puppy), Scrappy has taken it all in stride and has been a little ray of sunshine whenever I've hung out with him.  He is SUPER treat motivated (and could sniff out the smallest crumb!), loves to play fetch, and most of all, is incredibly affectionate.  Any chance he gets he'll prop his paws on me, smear himself into my lap, or give kisses.  And really, talking to him is all it takes to unleash that impossibly endearing wiggle!  He is really so sweet my heart swells just thinking about him...please come him see for yourself at Brooklyn ACC.",

She could circle the nearby park a few times although she does enjoy a rest by her caretaker's feet, watching peacefully what is going on around her. Hennessy is an adorable \"roussette\" (red head in French) always laying peacefully on her kuranda bed when found in her kennel...and ready to go out when she sees a potential caretaker at her door. She wags her tail a lot, looks at you with the most girly face, and gives little  kisses when you hold her head in your hands.  She loves treats, can sit for them, and even jump. Hennessy seems to like her peers when neared in the street or the yard. She looks so relaxed in the middle of a group of volunteers pointing out how delicious and friendly she is.

Kendrick loves to choose his own direction on walks, stopping often on a whim to change direction, although he's getting better at walking on the leash. A nervous Nellie at first, Kendrick prefers not to be touched without warning (he wants to get to know you first!). He seems to be housetrained, is very food-motivated (making him a great candidate for teaching tricks with treats!), and has a greyed snout that makes me think he's got a whole lot of wisdom to share.

Forever blurry with excitement at every moment life has to offer? Or is it her silly smile? One that covers her face in its entirety, starting with crinkled eyes and ending in flopping tongue, and is as infectious as it is sweet. But, really, we can't forget those Oreo cookie toes! Twenty opportunities for black and white colored sweetness and just a delight to behold. Morgan may be a Petite Pocket Pittie at just 37 lbs., but this little princess packs a punch. She lets me know straight away from her kennel that, \"Woof! I'm ready for my walk please!\" I'm ready, too, and so away we go with Morgan excitedly leading the way. And once those famous toes hit the grass of the park on a mild winter's day, that infectious smile breaks open like the sun from out the cloud. And now the whole world seems brighter. Morgan comes to us as a stray, so much of her past is unknown. I know that she takes her treats gently, loves any opportunity to meet new people, and is surprisingly patient and tolerant for her young age, having no issue at all being tethered. On our way back from our walk, Morgan is still nothing but smiles. Now with a head full of memories from today's endless fun and a heart full of hope for tomorrow. And when she hops effortlessly back into her kennel she turns to give me another \"Woof!\" And the look in those crinkled eyes could mean nothing else other than \"thank you.\" Morgan is a young, active girl who would do best with an experienced family. One who can help her perfect her leash manners and further her socialization with other pups. I don't think I can ever say what my favorite thing is about Morgan. But I know tonight that when my head hits the pillow I'll be dreaming of Oreo toes. Morgan is waiting in adoptions at Manhattan ACC.",

On our way out the door, everyone we pass stops to ask just who this chunky hunk is, and with a gentle approach, Benny's thrilled to make their acquaintance, too. A discerning dog for a discerning adopter, he's an enchanting combination of easy walking, sweet lap snuggling, cat friendly manners all wrapped up in a velveteen chocolate package--simply irresistible! His former owner liked how affectionate he is, and told us Benny would often lay his head on their lap. But I got even luckier during our date when he climbed his whole front half onto mine for cuddles and people-watching in the park. Benny's described as playful and happy to share his toys, but his main hobby was napping. He even slept in bed with his owner every night. Imagine the adorable Instagram possibilities when you welcome this snoozy sweetheart into your life and onto your sofa! Sociable with respectful dogs and relaxed around his feline friends, Benny would fit like a snuggly glove into a quiet, adult only home where he can build his confidence and keep on doing what he does best--love love loving on his family. Fall for Benny at our Manhattan Care Center today and that helicopter tail could soon be whirling its way out the front door and into a perfect forever home...with you!",

He's a smart boy, and when he sits, his posture is straight and serious, like he's learned at the finest finishing school. As other dogs pass us by, Jep is excited, signaling his wish to play with a bow, and in group with females (he's not been with males as of this writing), he loves a good bouncy game of chase. Fun, friendly, lively, affectionate, playful and an all around terrific puppy, Jep is ready to show you how much fun life can be. Ask to meet him today.",

Although too skinny in my opinion, and with a coat that needs some TLC (better nutrition will go a long way), he has an elegant prance to his step as if he was the best looking dog on the planet.  His fabulous personality sure makes him seem that way.  Everyone we meet is an immediate friend, he shows off his perfect sit for a treat, has the cutest little smile and a great whirlybird tail that never stops.  Gotham pottied outside on our walk, but we're told by his previous owner that he had accidents in the home, although we don't know how often he was walked. He's been social and playful with males and females in group play, but ignores other dogs that passed us.  He lived with young children and played hard, is well behaved when left home alone, loves chew bones, and knows sit and paw.   If Gotham were a human he's the person you'd want at your party, greeting everyone, happy to see and make friends with all, working the room and enjoying it all.   He's the dog you'll want to come home too, happy to see you, greeting you as if you'd been gone for days, and ready to wiggle his way into a cuddle.  A lifetime of cuddles with Gotham is just 'what the doctor ordered'.   Come meet him today!",

Something that will tempt you constantly, please you endlessly, and only leave you craving more. Little Colonel Sanders (\"C,\" as I like to call him) is bursting with excitement at the prospect of a walk, eagerly trotting his vanilla paws, a bit worn and worse for the wear, out straight ahead of me as we make our way to the park on a beautiful pre-spring day. C pulls slightly on leash, an eager young \"chick\", his sea-green eyes wide, and tends to his business straight away because tarrying, frankly, is for the birds. Soon we find a shady bench to pause upon, take a load off, rest our heads, and naturally snap some photos. And little Colonel is wholly unbothered, calm, and endlessly patient while tethered, wowing passersby with those stunning orbs. Colonel comes to us as a stray, so much of his past remains unknown. I know he loves his treats, sweetly nibbling them from my palm. That he could use more of them, maybe also a sudsy bubble bath to make his coat shine bright, and lots and lots of tender loving care, something he may not previously have known. I know he loves cuddles, snuggles, and hugs most of all. And that when he throws himself upon your lap and wraps his paws around you, it's as if he could never ever be close enough, and you hug him back like he never could. Colonel is a young, energetic boy who would do best with an experienced family, one who can provide him with the activity and care he needs, and also work on his occasional over-arousal and on-leash frustration. He may not exactly be \"finger-licking good,\" but he is delicious and sweet. And while he may not fill your stomach full to the brim, he will fill your heart, leave you sated and smiling, and always yearning for more. Colonel Sanders is waiting in adoptions at Manhattan ACC.",
